1..th       : Thorium Source Code
   - Human-writable Thorium program.
   - Example:
       function add : a int : b int : int
           ret a + b
   - Editable by developers.
   - Input to the Thorium compiler/interpreter.
   - Preserves comments, formatting, and module structure.

2. .thb      : Thorium Human-Readable Bytecode
   - S-expression style list-of-lists representation.
   - Scope-aware; optionally includes debug metadata.
   - Module name is Base64-encoded.
   - Identifiers (variables, functions, structs, strings) remain as names.
   - For inspection, debugging, or intermediate representation.
   - Example:
       [
         "dGhvcml1bV9leGFtcGxl",  ; Base64 module name
         [
           ["var", "immutable_value", "int", 42],
           ["function_def", "add", ["a","b"], "int",
               ["load", "a"], ["load", "b"], ["add"], ["ret"]
           ]
         ]
       ]

3. .thprg   : Thorium Internal Compiled Program
   - Fully compiled program ready for VM execution.
   - All identifiers replaced with numeric IDs.
   - Scope structure preserved.
   - Minimal metadata unless debug mode is enabled.
   - Optimized for distribution and execution by element90.
